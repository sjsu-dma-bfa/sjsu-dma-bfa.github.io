  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>"I am a communicating-with-the-world-with-everything-I-have person, so I use net art, projection mapping, and data visualization integrating with various mediums, as my tool to express myself in addition to language. We branch out the classification of emotions as we grow up. Therefore, a baby delivers their emotion by either just smiling or crying. I have already spent more than 20 years branching out my classification, but I still cannot name every emotion, tell why it emerged within myself, and how to control it. Before I used art as a tool to express myself, I tried to name all things. However, I realized I don’t have to. Art became one of my tools to express myself as a replacement of language, but I hope my art will help you understand those opaque concepts inside yourself and surrounding you as well. Interaction is a key of my art because our emotions only emerge through the interaction with the environment, so rather you just stand and watch it for a minute, I want you to USE my art as if you use the language to get and deliver information.

By using art as a tool to communicate, I hope the art world gets closer to you as if it is air; you really need it every single second but you do not notice. I spent 19 years in Japan and what I got from society by dreaming of being an artist is “No, you are not making anything. It is not necessary.” However, the crucial function of art is organizing what is in your head by making it tangible. When you are given anything in the world to use to express yourself, what do you do?"

<h2>Artist Bio</h2>
<hr>
<p>Tamaki Fujino explores the possibilities of art to express indescribable and opaque emotions, situations, relationships, technologies, and phenomena with interactive digital media, especially using projection mapping, coding, and data visualization as a replacement of language. Her main influence is psychological research. She started being attracted to psychology when she found one question to herself: Why am I crying?! In addition, to explore psychological findings, exploring the abstract concepts that exist in every culture is another theme of her art. God, love, dream, ghost, luck, and time: Those concepts are intangible, but shared in almost every culture. Therefore, examining those concepts reveals the pure elements of humans. In contrast, she also examines humans under the influence of cultures as well. She often uses conflicted ideas as she nurtured in the United States, after spending 19 years in Japan since she was born.
