  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>My work includes a hybrid of photography, digital art and illustration work. Since I have experience with such a variety of mediums I consider myself to be a digital media artist. Growing up in a digital revolution has inspired me to investigate how various technologies can be incorporated and/or enhanced into my artwork. As I grew accustomed to the field, my interest has shifted into 3D modeling and design which I intend to pursue after I finish the BFA Digital Media Art program at San Jose State University. I believe in making technology as accessible and easy to understand for everyone through interaction design.
