  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Ever since Emily was a child, digital media has always been a large part of her life, especially in the case of video games. She grew up playing games such as Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda. Along with that, Emily also watched many animated shows on TV and online such as Sailor Moon or the Winx Club. This soon evolved into a love of Japanese culture as she began to obsess over a plethora of genres in anime and manga in her teens. It was those games and shows that inspired her to become an artist and she often found myself drawing the characters during her free time. Emily began learning how to draw when she was 13 years old, but her view of the art world expanded very quickly soon after.
Part of her creative practice includes costume design and creation. Emily is an avid member of the cosplay community and she posts content on social media quite often. Her process involves a lot of measuring, patterning, and sewing as most fabric work does, but also involves a good amount of prop making. Each costume can take up to 8 months to make, and while the process can be quite long and difficult, the end result of a completed, well-made costume is well worth the work. To date, Emily has a little more than 10 costumes that she rotates between when she goes to events and conventions. These events are very close to her heart and she always enjoys meeting others who participate in the practice and showing off her work.
Outside of costume creation, however, her work is contained mostly in the world of digital art. Rarely do Emily paint pictures on a canvas or sculpt with clay or stone. She seeks beauty in everything she draws and prefers to create designs that are pleasing to the eye. She creates character designs through digital art. Through digital art, Emily wants to create interesting and engaging characters for video games and animations. Delivering a specific message through her work isn’t a priority for me, and She simply wants to create art that is beautiful. As stated earlier, Japanese culture has inspired a majority of her work, and Emily takes many elements from anime and manga, as well as Harajuku fashion to create her pieces.
Emily doesn't display her work in galleries or create installations, but post her work online for others to enjoy instead. she finds the ease of accessibility and ability to share with others worldwide the internet provides suitable for the art that she creates. Displaying her work in galleries or installations just isn’t the type of context that Emily believes fits her work. In this time of quarantine especially, being able to post her work and communicate with others through social media has helped her keep up her motivation to continue making art.  To me, being able to share her art with people all over the world without the need to leave her home satisfying enough for me.
