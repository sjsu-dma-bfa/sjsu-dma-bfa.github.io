  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>I create work to center and ground my placement in the world. I am not limited to any medium and always open to working and helping others. My work centers in around questions and experiments of what it means to be human and interact with the world. I do so by raising questions, thinking about my medium, and how to present it the best way to spread my message of how we are capable of thinking and making something important.

From living in Guangdong, Guangzhou, China during the ages of 9-14, I had to navigate a world where observational and pattern seeking skills aided in learning the unknown language creatively. I believe that through our relationship to others, media, and our past memories, I hope to bring about my explorations of identity as a catalyst for change. To create work to bring awareness to the familiar and bridge the connection between the spaces between us all.
